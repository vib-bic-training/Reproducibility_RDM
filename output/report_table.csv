Manuscript,Proofreading Approach to Improve Reproducibility in BioImaging Metadata Using AI (Artificial Intelligence) Language Models,"Tatiana Woller, Christopher J. Cawthorne, Romain Raymond, Agnes Slootmaekers, Ingrid Barcena Roig, Alex Botzki, Sebastian Munck","The paper discusses the challenge of maintaining reproducibility in BioImage data, similar to the challenges in deep space communications. It suggests the implementation of AI language model proofreading to improve error correction and consequently, the fidelity of the data.","The authors have created a workflow where the Large Language Model GPT-4 reads a lab notebook entry, a corresponding ManGO metadata file, and this publication to look for a list of keywords, and checks them for consistency across these metadata sources. Error correction is then performed by highlighting gaps and contradictions.",https://github.com/vib-bic-training/Reproducibility_RDM.git
ELN,What we can learn from deep space communication for reproducible BioImaging and data analysis,Not mentioned in the extract provided.,"The project deals with reproducible BioImaging and data analysis, adopting techniques from deep space communication. It involves running scripts interactively with GPT-4 through an API.","The scripts for this project are executed using Python 3.10. Dependencies are listed in the requirements_sm.txt file. The main interaction with GPT-4 is done via an API for which an API key is required from OpenAI. The accepted input formats for the scripts are pdf, txt, and json files.",The Github repository for the scripts and config files is found at https://github.com/vib-bic-training/Reproducibility_RDM. The project is based on https://github.com/kbressem/gpt4-structured-reporting.
ManGO Metadata,What we can learn from deep space communication for reproducible BioImaging and data analysis,"Tatiana Woller, Christopher Cawthorne, Romain Raymond Agnes Slootmaekers, Ingrid Barcena Roig, Alex Botzki, Sebastian Munck",The study discusses learning from deep space communication to improve the reproducibility of BioImaging and data analysis.,The research uses a Large Language Model (GPT-4) and follows the REMBI standard for their analyses.,The code and data used for the study can be found at https://github.com/vib-bic-training/Reproducibility_RDM.git.
All sources,What we can learn from deep space communication for reproducible BioImaging and data analysis,"Tatiana Woller, Christopher Cawthorne, Romain Raymond Agnes Slootmaekers, Ingrid Barcena Roig, Alex Botzki, Sebastian Munck","This paper discusses the issues regarding reproducibility in BioImage and data analysis. It offers a solution using the concept of error correction protocols used in space communication. The authors propose the use of AI language model proofreading to digest redundant metadata entries, visualize the differences, and correct errors. This method aims to increase metadata consistency, and improve overall documentation for higher reproducibility and reusability.","The authors implemented a workflow, where the GPT-4 Language Model reads different metadata sources, including a lab notebook entry, the corresponding ManGO metadata file, and this publication. These sources are searched for specific keywords to see their consistency. Then, conflicts and discrepancies are highlighted, allowing for error correction and improvement of the fidelity of the annotation.",[https://github.com/vib-bic-training/Reproducibility_RDM.git](https://github.com/vib-bic-training/Reproducibility_RDM.git)
