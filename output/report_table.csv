Manuscript,What we can learn from deep space communication for reproducible bioimaging and data analysis,"Tatiana Woller, Christopher J. Cawthorne, Romain Raymond Agnes Slootmaekers, Ingrid Barcena Roig, Alexander Botzki, Sebastian Munck","The paper discusses the challenge of maintaining reproducibility in BioImage data analysis, much like the challenges in deep space communications. It recommends the use of AI language model proofreading to improve error correction and consequently, the fidelity of the data.","The researchers created a workflow where the Large Language Model GPT-4 reads a lab notebook entry, a corresponding ManGO metadata file, and a publication to look for a list of keywords and check them for consistency across these metadata sources. Error correction is then performed by using AI to highlight gaps and contradictions.",https://github.com/vib-bic-training/Reproducibility_RDM.git
ELN,What we can learn from deep space communication for reproducible BioImaging and data analysis,Not specified,"The project aims to understand the learnings from deep space communication, which can be applied for better and reproducible BioImaging and data analysis.","The project relies on a Python-based main script which interacts with GPT-4 through an API (application programming interfaces). The user must obtain an API key from OpenAI to run the analysis. It accepts input in pdf, txt, json files format.",https://github.com/vib-bic-training/Reproducibility_RDM.git

It suggests using AI language model proofreading to consolidate various metadata entries, and improve error correction, consequently enhancing the fidelity of data and its documentation, thereby paving the way for higher reproducibility and reusability.","The main methodology involves the use of a large language model AI, specifically GPT-4, to process various metadata sources such as lab notebook entries, metadata files, and publications. This AI assists in checking for consistency across these metadata sources and performs error correction by highlighting gaps and contradictions. A Jupyter notebook was created for proofreading and comparing the different entries. The AI model's response in the form of a structured report was then used to visualize the similarities between the sources and to correct inconsistencies.","The code and workflows for the study have been made available in the following GitHub repository: ""https://github.com/vib-bic-training/Reproducibility_RDM.git""."
