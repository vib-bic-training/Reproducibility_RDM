Manuscript,"""Proofreading Approach to Improve Reproducibility in BioImaging Metadata Using AI (Artificial Intelligence) Language Models""","Tatiana Woller, Chris Cawthorne, Romain Raymond Agnes Slootmaekers, Ingrid Barcena Roig, Alex Botzki, and Sebastian Munck.","The paper discusses the implementation of error correction protocols, similar to those used in space communication, in BioImaging analysis. It suggests utilizing AI language model proofreading to provide error correction based on redundant documentation and increase the data fidelity in BioImage analysis.","The authors implemented a proof-of-concept workflow using the GPT-4 Large Language Model to proofread a lab notebook entry, a ManGO metadata file, and this publication. The model checks for the consistency of specific keywords across these sources. Identified gaps and contradictions are then highlighted, allowing for error correction and improvement of overall data fidelity.",https://github.com/vib-bic-training/Reproducibility_RDM.git
ELN,What we can learn from deep space communication for reproducible BioImage analysis,Not provided,The main topic of the project is utilizing the GPT-4 model from OpenAI for BioImage analysis in a reproducible manner.,"The methodology involves interaction with the GPT-4 model through an API, requiring an API key for OpenAI. The scripts are programmed in Python 3.10, which are run for performing the analysis.",The scripts and config files for the project can be found at https://github.com/vib-bic-training/Reproducibility_RDM. It is based on another project which is available at https://github.com/kbressem/gpt4-structured-reporting.

The suggested solution is the implementation of AI language model proofreading to improve error correction and consequently, the fidelity of the data.","The authors have created a workflow where the Large Language Model GPT-4 reads a lab notebook entry, a corresponding ManGO metadata file, and this publication to look for a list of keywords, and checks them for consistency across these metadata sources. Error correction is then performed by highlighting gaps and contradictions. The process is accomplished using a Jupyter notebook.",https://github.com/vib-bic-training/Reproducibility_RDM.git
